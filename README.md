### Hi there! 👋 I'm **Avi Levi**

I lead Learning & Development in a large bank in Israel, and I build tools that help people and organizations learn faster, better, and with measurable impact. I care about **practical AI**, **learning systems**, and turning “training” into **real performance improvement**.

#### What I’m into right now 🔥

- **AI-enabled learning workflows** (content, assessment, feedback, analytics)
- **Automation** with agent-like systems (n8n + APIs + smart prompts)
- **Micro tools** that remove friction for L&D teams
- **Dashboards + measurement** (because vibes are not a KPI 😄)

---

#### What you’ll find here 🧰

- Experiments and prototypes
- Internal-tool style apps (lightweight, fast, useful)
- Templates for learning processes (needs analysis, SME interviews, strategy workshops)
- Notes and demos on AI for L&D
